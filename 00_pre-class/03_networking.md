## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you develop a foundational understanding of computer networks, specifically focusing on TCP/IP and the OSI model, which are critical for understanding how data is transmitted over networks.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of networking, which will aid in troubleshooting network issues and improving your overall knowledge of web scraping and other network-related tasks. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is TCP/IP, and why is it important for computer networks?**  

    TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.

2. **What are the main functions of TCP in a network?**  

    TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client. Before it transmits data, TCP establish a connection between source and its destination, which it ensures remains live until communication begins.

3. **What role does IP play in a computer network?**  

    Every device with an internet connection has an IP addresses, whether it's a computer, laptop, IoT device, or even toys. The IP addresses allow for the efficient of data between two connected devices, allowing machines on different networks to talk to each other.

4. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP, and when would you use each?**  

    The main difference between TCP (transmission control protocol) and UDP (user datagram protocol) is that TCP is a connection based protocol and UDP is connectionless. While TCP is more reliable, it transfers data more slowly. UDP is less reliable but works more quickly.

5. **What is the OSI model, and why is it important in networking?**  

    The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers. Sending data over a network is complex because various hardware and software technologies must work cohesively across geographical and political boundaries.

6. **What is the first layer of the OSI model, and what is its function?**  

    The first layer of the OSI model is the physical layer, which is responsible for the physical connection between devices. 

    Function of first layer OSI model such as :
    - Defines the physical components of the network, such as cables, switches, and other physical components.
    - Defines the electrical, optical, and radio characteristic of the network.
    - Converts and transmits raw bit stream data over the physical medium.

7. **What does the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model do?**  

    Layer 4 of the OSI model, also known as the transport layer, manages network traffic between hosts and end systems to ensure compete data transfers.

8. **What is the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, and how does it work?**  

    Layer 3 of the OSI model : Network Layer provides the functional and procedural means of trasferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network, while maintaining the quality of service requested by the transport layer.

9. **What is the role of the application layer (Layer 7) in the OSI model?**  

    Layer 7 - The application Layer : The topmost layer of the OSI model, the application layer, serves as the interface for communication between users or processes and the network.

10. **How does understanding TCP/IP and the OSI model help in troubleshooting network issues?**  

    Understanding the TCP/IP and OSI models helps troubleshoot network issues by identifying where problems occur in the network
