## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you understand the concept of APIs, how they function in retrieving data, and their significance in web scraping tasks.

By the end of this exercise, you will gain the skills to utilize APIs effectively, learn the importance of reading documentation, and understand key terms like API keys, JSON, endpoints, and rate limits. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is an API, and how does it help get data from websites?**  

    APIs are a core component of web based applications which are accessible from any device with an internet connection.

2. **Why do some websites offer APIs instead of letting people copy data directly?**  

    Websites often provide APIs instead of allowing direct data copying through web scraping to maintain control over their data, reduce server load, ensure security, and comply with regulations. APIs offer structured and stable access to data, preventing disruptions caused by website design changes. They also enable businesses to monetize data by offering tiered access plans while protecting user privacy. Additionally, APIs help websites manage traffic efficiently by setting rate limits and authentication requirements. However, due to API restrictions, high costs, or limited data availability, web scraping remains a common alternative for data extraction.

3. **What is an endpoint in an API?**  

    An API endpoint is a digital location where an API receives requests for data or actions.

4. **What is a GET request?**  

    A GET request is an HTTP method used to fetch information from an API.

5. **What is an API key?**  

    API key is a code used to identify and authenticate an application or user.

6. **What is JSON?**  

    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

7. **What does "rate limit" mean?**  

    A rate limit is a restriction on how many actions or requests can be made within a given time frame.

8. **What is Postman?**  

    Postman is a software platform that helps developers build, test, and use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

9. **Why is it important to read the documentation before using an API?**  

    Learning to read API documentation is essential for developers and anyone working with APIs. it's essential in order to understand the API's purpose, usage, avoid errors, integrate it into their applications, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

10. **What are query parameters?**  

    Query parameters are key value pairs that are added to the end of a URL. They are also known as query strings or URL parameters.
