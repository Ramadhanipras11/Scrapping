    "### **File Handling**\n",
    "File handling in Python allows you to read, write, and manipulate files on disk. Using built-in functions like open(), along with context managers (i.e., the with-statement), you can ensure that files are properly managed and closed after operations, reducing the risk of resource leaks. The os module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality such as interacting with the file system. With os, you can navigate directories, create or delete files and directories, and perform path manipulations. Mastering these concepts is essential for automating file-based tasks and managing system resources effectively."
